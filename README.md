# NLP-Based-Emotion-and-Empathy-Detection-System-on-WASSA-2024-Dialogue-Dataset
This project focuses on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and predict emotion and empathy in multi-turn conversations. Using the WASSA 2024 Track-2 dataset, the task involves understanding how individuals express emotional responses and empathic reactions when discussing real-world events that involve harm or distress to people or communities.

The dataset contains dialogues where participants discuss the same news article, and each conversational turn is annotated with emotion intensity, emotion polarity, and empathy intensity scores. The main goal is to build models capable of predicting these three dimensions based on the content and context of each utterance.

To achieve this, the project explores several NLP and deep learning approaches — such as transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and context-aware sequence modeling — that capture not only the semantic meaning of individual sentences but also the emotional flow and relational cues across dialogue turns. Evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Pearson Correlation are used to measure model performance.

This study contributes to the broader field of affective computing and empathy modeling, with potential applications in mental health support systems, conversational AI, and emotionally intelligent chatbots.
